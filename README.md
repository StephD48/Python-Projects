# Python-Projects

These are basic projects I completed written in Python. They use various modules such as Tkinter, Sqlite3 and the framework Django.

**Projects:**

 * Phonebook
 * File Transfer
 * Django Checkbook
 
 
 **Phonebook**
 This project functions as a phonebook for a user.It saves a contact's name, phone number and email address
 in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries.
 
 **File Transfer**
 This project functions as a file transfer for the user. This allows the user to move text files that are new or have been modified within
 the last 24hrs. It allows the user to selecet a folder that will receive the copied files and also allows the user to manually file check the process.
 
 **Django Checkbook**
 This project uses Python and Django to create a functioning checkbook. It allows the user to add transactions and check their balance.
 The user can input the type of transaction and the date, description of the transaction and lets the user see thier current balance.
